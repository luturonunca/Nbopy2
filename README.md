# nbopy
Generates N-body models through Eddington inversion, and paints stellar probabilities on top using a distribution-function based approach. See [arXiv:1906.01642](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01642).

**nbody.py** generates the models  
**npaint.py** paints stars on top

To run on python2, add `from __future__ import print_function` .
